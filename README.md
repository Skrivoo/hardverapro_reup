## hardverapro_reup

This is a small script to reupload an advertisement to https://hardverapro.hu/.

### Motivation

Every ad is available for a month and after you would need to create a new one (the very same one). This is a copy and it can be automated.

### Usage

Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it as `.env`, than fill the values in it.
The script can be started with the `start` npm command. Example: `npm run start -- https://hardverapro.hu/apro/old_advertisement.html`
